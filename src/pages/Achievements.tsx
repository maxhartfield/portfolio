          <Card.Text>My eagle scout project was a 42 ft x 8 ft screening fence located at Saint Andrewâ€™s United Methodist Church in Plano. It took a total of 14 hours to complete with me and my fellow scouts. Building and designing this fence was an intricate task and took a great deal of effort. My favorite part of this project was personally welding together the gate. My eagle scout project demonstrates my ability to prepare, manage a budget, delagate tasks, communicate with my fellow scouts and my benificiary, etc. Here are some photos documenting the project:</Card.Text>

          <Card.Text>I have done gymnastics for 13 years of my life. Although I retired after senior year of high school, gymnastics still played a major part in my life and instilled skills like dedication, persistence, and time management. Gymnastics is a time consuming and physicaly demanding sport, and it was very difficult to manage school and 20 hours of gymnastics a week. Despite fracturing my spine twice, I recovered and eventually qualified for nationals. Here are some of my highlights:</Card.Text>
